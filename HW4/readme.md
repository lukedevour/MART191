# HW 4

## Work Progress

  This week went fine with regard to the actual coding assignment.
  I really enjoyed trying to figure out how my animation fit together, and I can see how this will be a powerful tool in our arsenal.

## Weekly Issues

  One issue encountered this week had to do with my github workflow. I feel like I have a much stronger grasp on what I am doing now, but I will still need a lot of practice. 

## Things To Work On

  * Github workflow
  * Practicing all the different functions
