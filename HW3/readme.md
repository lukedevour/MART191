# HOMEWORK 3 -- Monsters
  This week we started utilizing our new skills in p5.js.

  We used primitive shapes to complete pictures of monsters, or self-portraits for the braver folks.

## What have I done?
  My original idea was to make some sort of dragon. I quickly realized this was a little too ambitious for my newly developing skill set, so I decided on a simpler design.

  A big issue for me this week was trying to figure out exactly where I wanted my shapes.

### References
  The p5.js reference page was invaluable in trying to figure out my monster's general shapes. I also used a reference chart found in Google as a quick map for colors.
