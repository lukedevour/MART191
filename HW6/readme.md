# Homework 6
I had a lot of fun trying to figure out this assignment. It is extremely simple, but it makes me laugh. I seem to have figured out how to make my global variables work, which will be useful as hell in the future assignments.

## Issues
I had to go through several iterations before I was able to make this work for me in the style I desired.

## Breakthroughs
I think I might FINALLY understand variables.

## Results
Turn off the damn light!

## Future work
Conditionals seem to be the groundwork for all incredibly complex coding assignments, so I will have some major practice.
