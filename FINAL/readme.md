# Final Project
For my final project, my initial idea was a helicopter-run style game. After several iterations, I figured out that it was not going to work for me. My next idea was a Galaga style game in which the mouse controlled a spaceship on screen, and the player would avoid objects. After scrapping a few projects, I eventually ran out of time and decided on another algorithmic sketch. I really enjoyed my last sketch, and I am very interested in generative art overall.

## Work
I wanted to create a sketch that was generative in style, but once I upped the frame rate, it turned into a mess of bright colors and flashing that was very harsh on the eyes. I loved it. I don't mean any offense to any people who may actually have epilepsy. Epileptics should probably avoid this.

## Issues
-Everything gave me issues, from deciding on a direction to actual trying to implement ideas.
-I wanted my sketch to play music, but had issues setting up a local server, so imagine techno music playing.
-My sketch.js preview function stopped working partway through the assignment, so it will be interesting to see if my project actually works. I was able to preview my code through the index.html file.
