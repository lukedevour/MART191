# HOMEWORK 2 --
  This week we started utilizing our new skills in p5.js.

## Things we learned --
  1. Markdown syntax
    * And how to use it!
  2. Importance of pushing to github
    * Like when you lose your goddamn assignment!
  3. Fencing our codeblocks
  ```
  Like this.
  ```

## What have I done?
  Apparently this repository got deleted when I was figuring out how to upload to github, so this is me uploading the assignment again.

### References
  I used the markdown preview package as an invaluable tool in figuring out my code before I turn it in.
